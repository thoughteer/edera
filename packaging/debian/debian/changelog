edera (0.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduced MonitoringWorkflowExecuter and edera.monitoring:

  * Added a separate "offline" workflow to the daemon (useful to run monitor watchers)
  * Re-worked the Storage interface
  * Replaced DOA ZooKeeperStorage with more efficient MongoDB-based MongoStorage
  * Refactored duplicating tests (pytest is really full of magic)
  * Reorganized tests that involve external services (like ZooKeeper or MongoDB):
    - Such tests became optional
    - No test harnesses - only real service instances
    - Now you need to redefine corresponding environment variables in tox.ini
  * Simplified class factory declarations (like Qualifiers)
  * Fixed a couple of minor bugs
